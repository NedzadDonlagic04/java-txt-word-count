# java-txt-word-count

In this project I will make a java program that
will take a .txt file, read it and output all
the words that appear inside the .txt file as
well as the amount of times they appear in.

How to use:
1. Place given text inside example.txt
(if it does not exist run the code once,
it will be created)
2. Run the program
3. Check the console for the output
